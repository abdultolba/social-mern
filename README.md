## Installation
1. Install the dependencies in the main directory by running ```npm install``` in the terminal.
2. Create a config.js file in the ```/server``` directory with the following content:
```js
module.exports = {
    'MONGO_URI': // YOUR MONGO_URI GOES HERE,
    'SECRET_KEY': // YOUR PRIVATE KEY GOES HERE
}
